Ensure privacy and control with password-protected websites.
Implement robust security with encryption and other modern practices.

Password Protection: Users set a password to lock and unlock websites. Additional features like password strength indicators, recovery options, and two-factor authentication will be included.
Custom Block Page: When attempting to visit a locked site, users will see a custom block page with a password prompt.
Timeout Feature: Users can unlock websites temporarily, with automatic re-locking after a specified period.
Control Panel: Manage locked websites, change passwords, and configure additional settings via an easy-to-use interface.
Secure Data Storage: Locked websites and user passwords are stored securely using encryption.
